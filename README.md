# LittleCare_Webpage
This is the source code for the LittleCare charity webpage. It used Webflow to build the bulk of the frontend,<br>
and AWS Amplify to store and automate building the website (S3, docker management etc.) to get it online.

It also utilises AWS's Simple Email Service to notify the organisation if anyone had filled and used the contact form.<br>

The website is available at https://www.littlecarecharity.org/.<br>

This was mainly a project to start dipping myself into fullstack development, as I have been previously been diving in<br>
backend development.
